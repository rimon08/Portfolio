# Portfolio

A small group of projects using Python to showcase data analysis and visualization. The project studies the frequency of crimes committed in the San Francisco metro area. There is a graph showing which days have the most crimes committed, and another graph displaying frequency of arrest for various crimes. All of the data is pulled from a CSV file located in the directory.
